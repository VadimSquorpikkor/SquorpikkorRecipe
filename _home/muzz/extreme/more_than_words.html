    <h1>Extreme</h1>
    <h2>More Than Words</h2>

    Saying "I love you"<br>
    Is not the words I want to hear from you<br>
    It's not that I want you<br>
    Not to say but if you only knew<br>
    How easy, it would be to show me how you feel<br>
    More than words is all you have to do to make it real<br>
    Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me<br>
    'Cause I'd already know<br>
    What would you do<br>
    If my heart was torn in two?<br>
    More than words to show you feel<br>
    That your love for me is real<br>
    What would you say<br>
    If I took those words away?<br>
    Then you couldn't make things new<br>
    Just by saying "I love you"<br><br>
    La-di-da, da-di-da<br>
    Di-dai-dai-da<br>
    More than words<br>
    La-di-da, da-di-da<br>
    Now that I've tried to<br>
    Talk to you and make you understand<br>
    All you have to do is close your eyes<br>
    And just reach out your hands and touch me<br>
    Hold me close, don't ever let me go<br>
    More than words is all I ever needed you to show<br>
    Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me<br>
    'Cause I'd already know<br>
    What would you do<br>
    If my heart was torn in two?<br>
    More than words to show you feel<br>
    That your love for me is real<br>
    What would you say<br>
    If I took those words away?<br>
    Then you couldn't make things new<br>
    Just by saying "I love you"<br>
