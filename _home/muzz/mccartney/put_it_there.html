    <h1>Paul McCartney</h1>
    <h2>This One</h2>

    Give me your hand I'd like to shake it<br>
    I want to show you I'm your friend.<br>
    You'll understand if I can make it clear<br>
    Its all that matters in the end.<br><br>

    Put it there if it weighs a ton,<br>
    That's what the father said to his younger son.<br>
    I don't care if it weighs a ton,<br>
    As long as you and I are here, put it there.<br>
    Long as you and I are here, put it there.<br><br>

    If there's a fight I'd like to fix it,<br>
    I hate to see things go so wrong.<br>
    The darkest night and all it's mixed emotions,<br>
    Is getting lighter sing a song.<br><br>

    Put it there if it weighs a ton,<br>
    That's what the father said to his younger son.<br>
    I don't care if it weighs a ton,<br>
    As long as you and I are here, put it there.<br>
    Long as you and I are here, put it there.
