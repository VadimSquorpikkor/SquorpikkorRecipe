    <h1>Paul McCartney</h1>
    <h2>This One</h2>

    Did I ever take you in my arms,<br>
    Look you in the eye, tell you that I do,<br>
    Did I ever open up my heart<br>
    And let you look inside.<br><br>

    If I never did it, I was only waiting<br>
    For a better moment that didn't come.<br>
    There never could be a better moment<br>
    Than this one, this one.<br>
    The swan is gliding above the ocean,<br>
    A god is riding upon his back,<br>
    How calm the water and bright the rainbow<br>
    Fade this one to black.<br><br>

    Did I ever touch you on the cheek<br>
    Say that you were mine, thank you for the smile,<br>
    Did I ever knock upon your door<br>
    And try to get inside?<br><br>

    If I never did it, I was only waiting<br>
    For a better moment that didn't come.<br>
    There never could be a better moment<br>
    Than this one, this one.<br>
    The swan is gliding above the ocean,<br>
    A god is riding upon his back,<br>
    How calm the water and bright the rainbow<br>
    Fade this swan to black.<br><br>

    What opportunities did we allow to flow by<br>
    Feeling like like the timing wasn't quite right?<br>
    What kind of magic might have worked if we had stayed calm,<br>
    Couldn't I have given you a better life?<br><br>

    Did you ever take me in your arms,<br>
    Look me in the eye, tell me that you do?<br>
    Did I ever open up my heart,<br>
    Let you look inside?<br><br>

    If I never did it, I was only waiting<br>
    For a better moment that didn't come.<br>
    There never could be a better moment<br>
    Than this one, this one.<br>
    The swan is gliding above the ocean,<br>
    A god is riding upon his back,<br>
    How calm the water and bright the rainbow<br>
    Fade this swan to black
