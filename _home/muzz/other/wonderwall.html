        <h1>Oasis</h1>
        <h2>Wonderwall</h2>


        Today is gonna be the day that they're gonna throw it back to you<br>
        And by now, you should've somehow realised what you gotta do<br>
        I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now<br>
        And backbeat, the word is on the street that the fire in your heart is out<br>
        I'm sure you've heard it all before, but you never really had a doubt<br>
        I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now<br>
        And all the roads we have to walk are winding<br>
        And all the lights that lead us there are blinding<br>
        There are many things that I would like to say to you, but I don't know how<br>
        Because maybe<br>
        You're gonna be the one that saves me<br>
        And after all<br>
        You're my wonderwall<br>
        Today was gonna be the day, but they'll never throw it back to you<br>
        And by now, you should've somehow realised what you're not to do<br>
        I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now<br>
        And all the roads that lead you there were winding<br>
        And all the lights that light the way are blinding<br>
        There are many things that I would like to say to you, but I don't know how<br>
        I said maybe<br>
        You're gonna be the one that saves me<br>
        And after all<br>
        You're my wonderwall<br>
        I said maybe (I said maybe)<br>
