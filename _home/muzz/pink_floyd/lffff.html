        <h2>I'll Be There For You</h2>


        I guess this time you're really leaving<br>
        I heard your suitcase say goodbye<br>
        Well, as my broken heart lies bleeding<br>
        You say true love, it's suicide<br>
        You say you've cried a thousand rivers<br>
        And now you're swimming for the shore<br>
        You left me drowning in my tears<br>
        And you won't save me anymore<br><br>
        I'm praying to God you'll give me one more chance, girl<br><br>

        I'll be there for you<br>
        These five words I swear to you<br>
        When you breathe, I wanna be the air for you<br>
        I'll be there for you<br>
        I'd live and I'd die for you<br>
        I'd steal the sun from the sky for you<br>
        Words can't say what love can do<br>
        I'll be there for you<br><br>

        I know you know we've had some good times<br>
        Now they have their own hiding place<br>
        Well, I can promise you tomorrow<br>
        But I can't buy back yesterday<br>
        Yeah, baby, you know my hands are dirty<br>
        (Oh, woman, you know my hands are dirty)<br>
        But I wanted to be your Valentine<br>
        I'll be the water when you get thirsty, baby<br>
        When you get drunk, I'll be the wine, oh<br><br>

        I'll be there for you<br>
        These five words I swear to you<br>
        When you breathe, I wanna be the air for you<br>
        I'll be there for you<br>
        I'd live and I'd die for you<br>
        I'd steal the sun from the sky for you<br>
        Words can't say what love can do<br>
        I'll be there for you<br><br>

        I wasn't there when you were happy<br>
        (I wasn't there to make you happy)<br>
        And I wasn't there when you were down, down<br>
        Didn't mean to miss your birthday, baby<br>
        I wish I'd seen you blow those candles out<br>
        Oh<br><br>

        I'll be there for you<br>
        These five words I swear to you<br>
        When you breathe, I wanna be the air for you<br>
        I'll be there for you<br>
        I'd live and I'd die for you<br>
        I'd steal the sun from the sky for you<br>
        Words can't say what love can do<br>
        I'll be there for<br><br>
        I'll be there for you<br>
        These five words I swear to you<br>
        When you breathe, I wanna be the air for you<br>
        I'll be there for you<br>
        I'd live and I'd die for you<br>
        I'd steal the sun from the sky for you<br>
        Words can't say what love can do<br>
        I'll be there for you<br>
